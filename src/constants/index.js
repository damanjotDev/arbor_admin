    workHeading2:"Arborist Reports Include:",
    workMessage1:"An Arborist Report is a document written by a certified arborist about all aspects of a tree, including its species, health condition, pending safety concerns, and recommendations on how to mitigate problems. These reports are necessary for tree removal permits with municipalities or assurance on whether a tree on your property is a liability. They are extra valuable in the hands of current or prospective homeowners and contractors.",
